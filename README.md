# CMS Inpatient Analysis â€“ Medicare Cost & Utilization

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose

This project explores variation in inpatient hospital costs and outcomes across the U.S. using CMS Medicare data. The goal is to identify how costs differ by hospital type, region, and population characteristics â€” and to build payer-relevant metrics such as cost-efficiency, readmission-adjusted payment rates, and DRG-level benchmarking.

The project is built in Power BI and includes data modeling, Power Query transformations, and advanced DAX calculations, with a focus on producing analysis that is both actionable and scalable.
